<dt><b>keyboard</b><dd>A computer keyboard is one of
 the primary input devices used with a computer. 
Similar to an electric typewriter, a keyboard is 
composed of buttons that create letters, numbers, 
and symbols, as well as perform other functions. 
The following sections provide more in-depth information
 and answers to some of the more frequently asked 
questions about the keyboard.
<dt><b>mouse</b> <dd>A computer mouse is a handheld 
hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI 
(graphical user interface) and can move and select text, 
icons, files, and folders on your computer.
For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat 
surface such as a mouse pad or a desk in front of your 
computer. The picture is an example of a desktop 
computer mouse with two buttons and a wheel.
<dt><b>printer</b> <dd>A printer is an external 
hardware output device that takes the electronic 
data stored on a computer or other device and 
generates a hard copy of it. For example, if you created
 a report on your computer, you could print several copies
 to hand out at a staff meeting. Printers are one of the 
most popular computer peripherals and are commonly used 
to print text and photos. The picture is an example of 
an inkjet computer printer, the Lexmark Z605
<dt><b>speaker</b> <dd>A computer speaker is an output 
hardware device that connects to a computer to generate 
sound. The signal used to produce the sound that comes 
from a computer speaker is created by the computer's 
sound card. The picture shows the Harman Kardon 
Soundsticks III 2.1 Channel Multimedia Speaker System.
